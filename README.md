## Port Automation Android

**Automated Port Management Application**

This project aims to develop an Android-based mobile application for automated management of cargo handling equipment at port terminals. The application will implement several key features to optimize port operations and enhance efficiency:

**1. Prioritized Ship Handling:**

- Implement an automated system to prioritize ships based on their cargo type.
- Grant priority to ships carrying passengers and petroleum products.

**2. Intelligent Quay Management:**

- Integrate algorithms for quay management, assigning specific quays for different cargo types:
    - One dedicated quay for passenger ships.
    - Four designated quays for petroleum products.
    - Remaining quays for general cargo.

**3. Dynamic Quay Allocation:**

- Implement automated functionalities to release quays occupied by lower-priority ships upon arrival of passenger or petroleum vessels requiring immediate access to their reserved quays.
